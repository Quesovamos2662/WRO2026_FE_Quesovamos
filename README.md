## Meet the Team    
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Team Go!Cheese from Panama, participating in the WRO 2026 San Miguelito Regional in the Future Engineers category, Open Challenge.

Team Go!Cheese is made up of three unlikely friends who somehow decided that building an autonomous robot, learning GitHub, using BrickLink, programming, documenting, troubleshooting, and surviving WRO all at the same time was a good idea. This is our first time working with many of these tools and technologies, so this repository is not only a place for our source code, materials, and robot documentation, but also proof of our learning process.

Even if we do not achieve something huge in this competition, our goal is to step out of our comfort zone, learn as much as possible, and use this experience to come back stronger in the future. We may be beginners now, but we are determined to improve, keep building, and go beyond what we thought we were capable of.

## 1. Mobility & Mechanical Design   
### Driving base & chassis            

Our driving base and chassis are constructed entirely from the official LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Kit. This was decided beacuse of several technical factors we took into consideration.

First, LEGO components offer native compatibility with the EV3 brick, which reduces the difficulty of mounting sensors and motors. And second, LEGO builds allows structural issues to be identified and corrected rapidly during testing. Additionally, Lego builds don't need any external parts or pieces, as there is almost always an official Lego piece that does the job you need.

But an all-LEGO build introduces limitations. These come in the form of the plastic frame having measurable flex at higher speeds, and connection points being able to loosen if the frame withstands powerful impacts. Despite these possible shortcomings, we still believed that we could make our car work, so we chose to build in this manner.



### Motor selection & torque reasoning 

Our vehicle uses two LEGO Mindstorms EV3 motors: one large and one medium. These are connected directly to the EV3 brick via ports A and B. Both motors were chosen for their natural compatibility with the rest of our components and their ability to provide reliable speed and torque on their own.

The large motor, used for moving and load-bearing propulsion, has a top speed of 170 RPM, a running and stall torque of 20Nxcm and 40 Nxcm respectively, an operating voltage of 9V, and a weight of 76g. It trades off speed for torque. This trade-off is required to properly move load since driving needs to overcome the inertia of the chassis, rolling resistance, and friction in the drivetrain. Compared to the medium motor, it has a higher rotational inertia. Its heavier rotor stores momentum and allows for a smoother delivery where any resistance can be pushed through without much stalling. It can also be used for measuring distance through its rotations. It is bulkier and larger compared to a medium motor, and for us, this design structure makes it unfit to be placed on the front of the robot. It would also compete for space with the steering chassis and add weight on undesirable areas. Based on this, we can say that its most defining trait is the high torque that accelerates the robot's mass and does feats unmatched by a medium motor.

Finally, the medium motor has a top speed of 250 RPM, a running torque of 8Nxcm, a stall torque of 12Nxcm, and an operating voltage of 9V and a weight of only 36g. This motor's higher RPM and lower torque make it better suited for steering. Its low weight also helps on making our robot lighter, benefiting its speed overall. We can say that the medium motor is the total opposite of the large motor. It has a low rotational inertia that allows for reversible motion, which is heavily required for quick adjustments and steering in our PID-focused build. It has a lighter rotor that allows for quick acceleration and reversals. Since steering is a very repetitive task of moving back-and-forth and center-to-sides, a motor with easy direction changes is needed to produce tighter, more stable steering corrections. The medium motor has a rotation sensor built-in, and it allows for the control of all angles. Steering is about absolute position. It needs to perfectly hold positions, so proportional steering and reliable centering become possible. It has higher speed compared to the large motor snd it helps for quick position-switching. The medium motor is also smaller, flatter, and lighter than the large motor. As previously mentioned, the steering area of the chassis task most of the available space at the front. The motor's compact body easily fits there, and its light weight prevents the steering mechanism from sagging. 


### Steering mechanism (Ackermann)   

Our robot uses an Ackermann steering mechanism on the front axle, which 
is controlled by the EV3 medium motor. In this type of steering, the two 
front wheels turn at different angles when the robot takes a turn. The 
inner wheel turns more sharply than the outer one. This is important because both wheels are tracing different sized arcs at the same time, and if they were forced to turn at the same angle, they would drag and scrub against the ground instead of rolling cleanly. Ackermann geometry solves this by giving each wheel the correct angle for the arc it needs 
to follow.

We chose this steering system because the WRO track has four corners per 
lap, and we needed our robot to take them consistently and without losing 
control. The medium motor controls steering through direct angle commands rather 
than timed pulses. The code calls `on_to_position()` with a target angle 
in degrees (`ANGLE_CENTER`, `ANGLE_GENTLE`, `ANGLE_MEDIUM`, `ANGLE_STRONG`, 
or `ANGLE_DANGER`), and the motor moves to that exact position and holds 
it with the brake engaged. This is more precise than a timed-pulse 
approach, since the motor always reaches the same physical angle 
regardless of small variations in motor speed or friction.


### Chassis iterations               

Our robot went through one major structural redesign between its first 
and final version.

In the original design, the EV3 brick was mounted horizontally at the center of the chassis, with starting button facing the front of the robot. The orientation in which the EV3 was placed made it hard to access the starting button of the EV3. Initially, the chassis was more compact and smaller. Because we wanted the car to be as swift as possible, we thought of that decision. We also worked on building the Ackermann steering geometry, but when placing the medium motor to test the steering, we noticed the motor had a hard time to position the whole geometry. It used a technic liftarm 1 x 3, some technic pins, and a 3L axle with stop. The pins and the technic liftarm didn't allow for flexible movement, so we had to scratch it from our plans. When we worked on the original design, we also planned on using wheels of the same side for both the front and rear motors. Overall, the first design was unstable and rigid. This was because we made the design in the BrickLink modeling software before building it physically using the LEGO MINDSTORMS kits.

For the final version, we rebuilt the chassis with the EV3 brick mounted horizontally but rotated around so that the buttons and display of the EV3 were facing the large motor at the back. Since there was more space between the EV3 brick and the large motor, our hands could easily reach the buttons. We also lengthened the chassis on the front. This sacrificed our idea of a smaller chassis with higher speed, but gave us more stability. To do that, we had to add several more structures that were able to hold the longer technical liftarms at the front. We also added some support on the sides of the medium motor at the front, so the motor would not be moving aggresively from side to side while steering and potentially cause us more trouble when testing. We switched a technic liftarm 1 x 3 with a connector with pin alongside an 3L axle with stop to fix the rigid movement of the steering mechanism. We added support to the large motor, it would stay straight and keep the tires tight against it. Additionally, the rear tires were changed to a bigger size. For reference, we were using 13.2 x 22 ZR sized tires on both front and rear, but after seeing the unsteadiness of the overall chassis, we changed the rear tires to some sized 56 x 28 ZR. It is worth mentioning that we added more technical pins and connectors than expected. When we recreated the virtual model using the kits, we found out that most structures of the modeled chassis had a lot of problems with connections and stability.

Here is an image adjunct showing the difference between both steering mechanisms and planned front of the chassis:

## 2. Power & Sensor Architecture   

For our controller and power supply, we used a standard LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Brick. We chose this brick because it works as both the brain and the battery of our robot, meaning all of our sensors and motors draw power directly from it without needing any external power source or voltage regulators.

The brick has 16 MB of flash memory, 64 MB of RAM, and outputs between 
0V and 9V depending on the component connected. Its rechargeable battery 
has a maximum capacity of 2000 mAh. To decompose our power usage, our three ultrasonic sensors consume approximately 3.3V each at low current, and our two motors consume the most power during movement and recovery maneuvers. Running all five components simultaneously stays well within the brick's output capacity. 

During early testing sessions we experienced several unexpected shutdowns mid-run, not due to hardware failure, but 
because we neglected to fully charge the battery before testing. This taught us to treat battery management as part of our testing routine, and we made it a standard practice to verify battery level on the EV3 display before every run. After adopting this habit, we did not experience any further power interruptions during testing.

This experience also reinforced an important operating constraint: the 
robot only performs reliably when the battery has sufficient charge to 
power the full system simultaneously. Since the EV3 brick supplies all 
five components (three sensors and two motors) from a single 2000 mAh 
source, a partially depleted battery does not cause the robot to fail 
outright, but it does reduce motor torque and steering responsiveness 
enough to affect navigation accuracy. This is because we use a PID system (Proportional-Integral-Derivative), which relies heavily on the power our robot is supplied with. Thankfully, the EV3 brick has a respectable and sufficient power output, which makes our PID system workable. Even though using other batteries could prove to be more efficient, an EV3 brick works just fine. However, if we get more time to tinker and develop our robot, we might switch the brick out for a battery for the reason of efficiency.



### Wiring diagram  

The diagram below shows how all sensors and motors connect to the EV3 brick. Ultrasonic sensors plug into sensor ports 1, 2, and 3, while the medium and large motors connect to motor ports A and B respectively. All connections use standard LEGO Mindstorms cables with no external wiring.

> (`OUTPUT_A`, `OUTPUT_B`, `INPUT_1`, `INPUT_2`, `INPUT_3`). The connections 
> shown reflect exactly how our sensors and motors are wired to the EV3 
> brick.

### Sensor selection & placement    

For our sensor setup, we use three ultrasonic sensors, each connected to 
its own dedicated input port and serving a different role in the 
robot's decision-making: `INPUT_1` (left), `INPUT_2` (front), and 
`INPUT_3` (right). Since we do not have a camera, these three readings 
are the only information the robot has about its surroundings.

We chose ultrasonic sensors over infrared specifically because their 
output is a direct distance measurement in centimeters. This matters for 
our code because nearly every decision layer in `navigate()` compares a 
sensor reading against a numeric threshold, such as `HIT_RISK_CM = 18`. 
An infrared sensor's relative proximity value would not give us a 
consistent number to compare against across different lighting 
conditions or surface materials on the track.

The left and right sensors are mounted at mid-chassis height, facing 
perpendicular to the direction of travel. Their primary job is feeding 
the PID controller: the difference between the left and right readings 
is the main input the controller uses to calculate a centering error and 
adjust the steering angle smoothly. They are also checked independently 
in the wall guard and emergency layers (`SIDE_EMERGENCY_CM = 48`, 
`WALL_GUARD_CM = 88`), since a robot can be too close to one wall while 
still being far from the other.

| Old front view | New front view (sensors active) |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![Old front](v-photos/front_old.jpg) | ![Sensor placement front](v-photos/sensor_placement_front.jpg) |

The front sensor is mounted facing forward and has a completely 
different job from the side sensors: it does not feed the PID controller 
at all. Instead, it exclusively drives the corner detection logic. Three 
separate front distances (`FRONT_GENTLE_CM = 235`, `FRONT_MEDIUM_CM = 178`, 
`FRONT_STRONG_CM = 128`) let the program distinguish between a corner 
that is still far away and one that is immediately ahead, responding 
with a proportionally gentler or stronger turn.

The images below show each ultrasonic sensor active and mounted on the 
robot: the front sensor facing forward, and the left and right sensors 
facing outward perpendicular to the direction of travel.

| ![Front sensor](v-photos/sensor_placement_front.jpg) | ![Left sensor](v-photos/sensor_placement_left.jpg) | ![Right sensor](v-photos/sensor_placement_right.jpg) |

### Sensor calibration              

Our ultrasonic sensors do not require manual calibration in the traditional sense, since they output distance readings in centimeters directly. Instead, calibration for our robot meant finding the right threshold values through physical testing on a mock track.

For the side sensors, we tested different WARN distances until we found 20 cm as the value that gave the robot enough time to correct without overcorrecting on straight sections. For the front sensor, we tested values between 35 cm and 60 cm before settling on 55 cm as the distance 
that consistently allowed the robot to begin turning before reaching the corner wall. These values are defined as constants at the top of our code and can be adjusted if the robot is used on a track with different 
wall spacing.

## 3. Software Architecture            

### Algorithm description

The vehicle's navigation software is written in Python 3 using the 
ev3dev2 library, and runs directly on the EV3 brick. Instead of using a 
camera or color sensors, our robot relies entirely on distance readings 
from its three ultrasonic sensors to make decisions.

The core of the program is a PID controller (Proportional-Integral-
Derivative) that continuously centers the robot between the left and 
right walls during normal driving. The controller uses KP = 0.56 and 
KD = 1.22, while the integral term (KI) is kept at 0 because ultrasonic 
sensors are too noisy for integral correction to be reliable. This makes 
our implementation closer to a PD controller in practice, even though 
the structure supports a full PID if needed later.

PID centering only runs when conditions are safe. Several priority 
layers sit above it and override it whenever the robot is close to a 
wall, approaching a corner, or just exited one. The function navigate() 
evaluates these layers in order on every loop cycle, from most urgent to 
least urgent, and the first layer that applies takes control for that 
cycle.

The program also tracks laps by counting corners, using the front 
sensor distance to detect when the robot enters and exits a turn. After 
4 corners, one lap is registered, and after 3 laps the robot can stop. 
As an additional safety net, the program also stops automatically once 
99 seconds have passed since the run started, since testing showed this 
time consistently brings the robot back near its starting position 
after completing the required laps.

### Flowchart                         

The following flowchart illustrates the priority-based logic our program 
follows on every cycle. The robot continuously checks four conditions in 
order. If any condition is met, it acts and restarts the loop. If none 
are met, it drives straight and stays centered until the next cycle.

> based entirely on our own code logic. The structure, priorities, and 
> decisions shown reflect our program exactly as written by our team.

### Obstacle & corner handling   

The function navigate() evaluates the robot's situation through nine 
layers, checked in this exact order every cycle:

**1. Absolute hit risk:** If any sensor reads at or below 18 cm, the 
robot treats this as a panic situation. It resets the PID controller and 
steers hard (90°) away from the closer side at reduced speed.

**2. Emergency wall avoidance:** If the front sensor reads at or below 
58 cm, or either side sensor reads at or below 48 cm, the robot performs 
the same hard steering response as the hit risk layer. This acts as a 
last line of defense that should rarely trigger if the wall guard layer 
below is working correctly.

**3. Post-corner centering:** For a short window after completing a 
corner, side sensor readings are capped at 75 cm. This prevents the 
robot from misreading an open corner exit as no wall detected and 
driving off course before it reconnects with the next straight wall.

**4. Front wall / corner logic:** The front sensor decides cornering 
behavior independently of the PID controller. Three thresholds control 
how sharply the robot turns: 128 cm triggers a strong turn (70°), 178 cm 
triggers a medium turn (45°), and 235 cm triggers a gentle turn (25°). 
The robot always turns toward whichever side has more open space.

**5. Blind side detection:** On straight sections, if one side sensor 
reads an unusually large distance (over 180 cm, suggesting it missed 
the wall at an angle) while the other side is reasonably close, the 
robot steers away from the side it can still detect.

**6. Wall guard:** This is the main correction layer for normal driving. 
It activates progressively as either side wall gets closer than 88 cm, 
escalating to a stronger correction if a wall drops below 68 cm.

**7. PID side-wall centering:** When both side readings are valid and no 
wall is dangerously close, the PID controller continuously adjusts 
steering angle to keep the robot centered between both walls.

**8. Single-side fallback:** If only one side sensor is giving a valid 
reading, the robot falls back to a threshold-based correction using that 
single sensor.

**9. Safe driving:** If none of the above apply, the robot drives 
straight ahead at full speed with the steering centered.

All sensor readings also pass through an anticipation function that 
detects sudden drops in distance between cycles, allowing the robot to 
react slightly earlier than the raw sensor value would suggest.


### Tuning process                     

Unlike a simple threshold system, tuning this PID-based program required 
adjusting both the controller gains and the priority layer distances 
together, since they interact with each other.

Our first challenge was PID oscillation. With early KP and KD values, 
the robot zigzagged between the two side walls instead of holding a 
steady center line. We lowered KD and adjusted KP gradually until the 
robot settled into smooth centering on straight sections. We kept KI at 
0 throughout testing, since enabling it made the robot drift 
unpredictably due to ultrasonic sensor noise.

Our second challenge was emergency triggering too late. Our original 
emergency distance was set lower, around 35 cm, but the robot did not 
have enough time to steer away before contact. We raised it to 58 cm for 
the front sensor and 48 cm for the sides, which gave the steering motor 
enough time to respond before the hit risk layer had to take over.

Our third challenge was corners. Early corner thresholds caused the 
robot to either turn too late and clip the wall, or turn too early and 
cut across the track before the corner actually started. We tuned the 
three-stage front distances (128 / 178 / 235 cm) through repeated runs 
until the robot consistently began turning at the right point for each 
severity of corner.

Finally, the 99 second run time limit was tuned by timing several 
complete three-lap runs and adjusting the value until the robot reliably 
stopped close to its starting position after finishing.

## 4. Engineering Decisions           

### Design decision log    

Every major component choice our team made involved weighing alternatives 
against our constraints as first-time competitors with limited experience 
and a fixed timeline. This section documents the reasoning behind our most 
significant decisions.

Instead of using a sensor to detect the starting zone for parking, we chose a time-based approach. After running the robot multiple times and measuring how long a full three-lap run took, we set a 99 second limit that reliably stops the robot near its starting position. This 
was simpler to implement and worked consistently during our tests.

*EV3 over Arduino*

Early in the planning phase, we considered building the robot around an 
Arduino microcontroller, as it initially seemed like a flexible option for connecting multiple components. However, we quickly determined that Arduino 
was not the right fit for our team at this stage. As first-time competitors 
with no prior robotics experience, the process of wiring individual components, managing voltage levels, writing low-level driver code, and debugging hardware connections within our available time was beyond what we could realistically execute. The LEGO Mindstorms EV3 ecosystem offered a fully integrated solution — motors, sensors, brick, and software all designed to work together — which allowed us to focus our limited time on solving the actual navigation problem rather than on hardware setup.

*Three ultrasonics over two*

Our initial sensor layout used only two ultrasonic sensors on the left and 
right sides of the vehicle. During early testing we identified a blind spot 
directly in front of the robot. The side sensors could not detect a wall ahead until the robot was already too close to correct in time. This led us to add a third ultrasonic sensor facing forward, which 
became the dedicated input for our corner detection logic, controlled by 
the `FRONT_GENTLE_CM`, `FRONT_MEDIUM_CM`, and `FRONT_STRONG_CM` thresholds 
in our current code.

*Medium motor for steering over a servo*

We considered using a servo motor for the Ackermann steering mechanism, as 
servos are commonly used in RC car designs for precise angle control. 
However, given our fully LEGO-based chassis, integrating an external servo 
would have required custom mounting solutions and additional wiring outside 
the EV3 ecosystem. The EV3 medium motor provided sufficient steering response through timed pulses and remained fully compatible with our structure and ev3dev2 library.

### What didn't work       

*Infrared sensor as front obstacle detector*

Our original design used an infrared sensor mounted at the front of the 
robot to detect the distance between the vehicle and the wall ahead. In theory, the infrared sensor offered a narrower detection beam than an ultrasonic sensor, which we believed would reduce false positives from angled surfaces. In practice, the sensor performed poorly under repeated collision conditions. After several impacts during testing, its readings became inconsistent and unreliable, causing the robot to either fail to detect walls or trigger corrections at incorrect distances. We replaced it with a third ultrasonic sensor (EV3 model, INPUT_2), which proved 
significantly more robust and consistent across all testing sessions.

*Threshold-based steering caused oscillation*

Our first version of the navigation loop fired a steering correction 
every single cycle whenever a sensor read below its warn threshold. This 
caused the robot to oscillate violently in straight sections — it would 
correct right, then immediately correct left on the next cycle, then 
right again, producing a zigzag pattern instead of a straight line. 
This is what led us to abandon pure threshold-based steering and 
implement a PID controller instead, which corrects proportionally to 
how far off-center the robot is rather than firing a fixed correction 
every time a threshold is crossed.

*Pure threshold-based steering replaced by PID*

Even after fixing the oscillation problem in our early threshold-based 
version, the robot's centering still felt mechanical: it would not 
correct until crossing a specific distance, then overcorrect, then wait 
again. We replaced this entire approach with a PID controller for normal 
centering, which calculates a proportional correction based on exactly 
how far off-center the robot is, rather than reacting only at fixed 
trigger points. This made centering noticeably smoother, though it 
required more tuning time since two gains (KP and KD) had to be balanced 
against each other instead of a single threshold value.

*Single fixed front threshold was not enough*

Our initial corner logic used a single front distance threshold to 
decide when to turn. This caused the robot to either clip the wall on 
sharp corners or turn unnecessarily early on shallow ones, since one 
distance value could not represent every corner severity correctly. We 
replaced this with three separate thresholds (128 / 178 / 235 cm), each 
triggering a different turn strength, which allowed the robot to respond 
proportionally to how sharp each corner actually was.

### Build instructions   

**Chassis**

The chassis is built entirely from LEGO Technic beams and connectors included in the EV3 Core Set (45544). The large motor is mounted longitudinally at the rear of the chassis and drives the back axle 
directly. The EV3 brick is mounted horizontally at the center of the 
chassis, serving as both the computational unit and the structural 
backbone of the vehicle.

**Steering**

The front axle uses an Ackermann steering geometry driven by the medium motor. The medium motor is mounted vertically above the front axle and connected to the steering linkage via a LEGO Technic gear. Steering angle is controlled by timed pulses in software rather than by position feedback, so no additional angle sensor is required.

**Sensor placement**

- `INPUT_1` — EV3 Ultrasonic sensor mounted on the left side of the 
chassis, facing perpendicular to the direction of travel, at 
approximately mid-chassis height.
- `INPUT_2` — EV3 Ultrasonic sensor mounted at the front of the vehicle, 
facing forward along the direction of travel.
- `INPUT_3` — NXT Ultrasonic sensor mounted on the right side of the 
chassis, facing perpendicular to the direction of travel, mirroring 
the left sensor placement.

**Software setup**

1. Install ev3dev on a microSD card following the official guide at 
[ev3dev.org](https://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/)
2. Copy `src/pidWITHstop.py` to the EV3 brick via SSH or the VS Code ev3dev 
extension
3. Run the program: `python3 pidWITHstop.py`
4. Place the robot on the track and press the center button to begin

The following video shows our robot completing an autonomous run on the
